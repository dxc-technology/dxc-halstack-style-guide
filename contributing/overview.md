## Editing pages

### Pull requests

To update any of our documentation pages you will need to fork our repository and then make a contribution. See how you can [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to propose changes you've made to a fork of our repository.

[DXC Assure Digital Platform contribution guidelines](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/blob/3.2.0/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-via-github-pull-requests
).

## Creating pages

Our documentation is organized following the structure:

```
guidelines  
|   catalog.json
|
└───components 
│   │
│   └───component_folder
│       │    miniature.png
│       │    README.md
│       │   
│       └─── images
|                image_example.png   
│          
└───principles
    │   color
    │   typography
    |   ...
 
```
Follow these steps when creating new content:

1. Create a new folder inside `guidelines/principles` or `guidelines/components`
2. This folder should contain a `README.md` file and a `images` folder
3. Only add the `miniature.png` file when adding a new component, no needed for principles

Every component documentation or priciples added should follow the same structure.

### Editing the catalog.json file

In order to update the content in our documentation site the `catalog.json` file need to track the new additions:

```
{
  "principles": [  ],
  "components": [  ]
}
```

Inside the `principles` or `components` array add the following:

```
 {
      "key": "overview",
      "name": "Overview"
    },
```

* **key**: name of the folder placed inside `guidelines/principles` or `guidelines/components`
* **name**: this value will be displayed in [Developer central](https://developer.dxc.com/design/guidelines/principles/overview) site navigation
