# Halstack Design System

Halstack is the DXC Technology's open source design system for insurance products and digital experiences. Our system provides all the tools and resources needed to create superior, beautiful but above all, functional user experiences.

## Design principles

Halstack design principles are the fundamental part of DXC Technology's approach to provide guidance for development teams in order to deliver delightful and consistent user experiences to our customers:

- Balance
- Consistency
- Visual hierarchy

All our components, design tokens, accessibility guidelines, responsive design techniques, and layout proposals have been carefully curated by DXC design and engineering teams with the objective of creating a unique visual language and ecosystem for our applications. This is the DXC way of creating User Experiences.

## Open Source

Halstack is an open source design system, this means that we work towards DXC Technology bussines needs, but it is open for anyone to use and contribute back to.

We are charmed to receive external contributions to help us find bugs, design new features, or help us improve the project documentation. If you're interested, definitely check out our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-style-guide/blob/master/contributing/overview.md).

## Our Assets

### Design

In addition to our design guidelines, we mantain an [Adobe XD public library](https://shared-assets.adobe.com/link/732533f4-d925-487e-4761-9a760574cfac) in order to provide designers all the building blocks needed to quickly create solutions for our clients. Helping them focusing on innovation and user experience.

### Code implementation

We also have our components documentation available in the following frameworks:

- [React documentation](https://developer.dxc.com/tools/react/next/#/)
- [Angular documentation](https://developer.dxc.com/tools/angular/next/#/)

If youâ€™re using a different framework, you can still build components by following our design guidelines.
