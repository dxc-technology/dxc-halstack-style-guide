# Introduction to Halstack Design System

Our design principles are the fundamental part of DXC Technology's approach to provide guidance for development teams in building and delivering new digital User Experiences.

Balance, consistency and visual hierarchy are the key elements of our of design principles. We just want to deliver superior, beautiful but above all, functional User Experiences to our customers. All these design principles, tokens, accessibility guidelines, responsive design techniques, and layout proposals have been carefully curated by DXC design and engineering teams with the objective of creating a unique visual language and ecosystem for our applications. This is the DXC way of creating User Experiences.

Each UI component has its own design specifications together with their design properties (or tokens) attached to them. We encourage UX Designers to consider both the general principles and the component specifications when designing new User Experiences in order to achieve the expected results, which will help developers in building superior API-driven applications.
