# Slider

Slider control allows users to select a specific value or a range of values from a set. Usually, slider presents a relatively large dataset and the way that the user interacts with it is helpful to explore the multiple options swiftly.

## Appereance

The appearance of the component is not that complex, it is represented most of the time with a line where are mapped all the values that can be selected. Apart from that, it is needed a control to move it side by side to pick a specific value fron the range.

### Modes

Three modes are available for a slider control.

- A discrete mode, that only can get the value marked along the slider
- A continuous mode, that can take every value mapped into slider from the beginning to the end.

Modes: **discrete** or **continuos**.

### States

Seven different states are defined in the life cycle of the component: **enabled**, **disabled**, **hovered**, **focused** and **dragged**.

## User Interface Design Considerations

- Visualize the output of the slider as feedback to the user of the current state.
- As more information can give it to the user, the easier the selection will be.
- If the value has to be specific, give some resource to the user to fill a precise input, i.e. an input next to the slider.

To accomplish these considerations, some slider's variations were designed with the purpose of offering a great user experience within the application.
