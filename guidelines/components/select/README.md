# Select

A select component is a right choice to preventing errors with predefined options, also they reduce the vertical space by showing several options in a reduced space. Selects are used in forms, letting the user select an option instead using an input.

## Appearance

Select is widely recognizable, despite the options are not shown at the first instance, an icon with a down arrow indicates that clicking in the field the list will be visible. In the input, the placeholder defines the attribute that will get the value. 

* The options list will be displayed immediately above the placeholder, to get visible all the time which form fill attribute is the user filling.
* In case that an option is selected when the dropdown turns visible, it should be at the top of the dropdown whenever this would be possible.
* Multiple option selection will get an appearance with a checkbox that indicates the elements from the list that are selected or not.


## States

### Select input

States are defined for select component based on the interactions that the user can reproduce. The states are: **enabled**, **focus**, **error** and **disabled**:

![Select states](images/select_states.png)

### Options list

The options have two states: **enabled**, **hover**, **focus** and **selected**:

## Multiple selection

Allows the user to select more than one option from the list. To indicate which items are selected and which not, the design for multiple selections integrates a checkbox pairing with each option from the dropdown.

## Accessibility

### WCAG 2.2

**Understanding WCAG 2.2** - [SC 3.2.2: On Input](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/on-input.html)

* Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior before using the component.

### WAI-ARIA 2.1 

**WAI-ARIA practices 2.1** - [3.14 Listbox](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#Listbox)

* An element that contains or owns all the listbox options has role `listbox`.
* Each option in the listbox has role `option` and is a DOM descendant of the element with role listbox or is referenced by an `aria-owns` property on the listbox element.
* If the listbox is not part of another widget, then it has a visible label referenced by `aria-labelledby` on the element with role listbox.
* In a single-select listbox, the selected option has `aria-selected` set to true.
* If the listbox supports multiple selection:
  * The element with role `listbox` has `aria-multiselectable` set to true.
  * All selected options have `aria-selected` set to true.
  * All options that are not selected have `aria-selected` set to false.
* If the complete set of available options is not present in the DOM due to dynamic loading as the user scrolls, their `aria-setsize` and `aria-posinset` attributes are set appropriately.
* If options are arranged horizontally, the element with role `listbox` has `aria-orientation` set to horizontal. The default value of `aria-orientation` for listbox is vertical.


## User Interface Design Considerations

### Single select

- A dropdown element should allow the user to select one option from a list.
- The select component should always display a label, different from any name in the option list.
- If the options list is extensive, consider letting the user type for suggestions filtering the whole number of options.
- A default choice can be displayed as the placeholder before user selection. It must be placed as the first item on the options list and appear selected.
- Use progressive disclosure between linked select components.

### Multi-select

- If more than one option is applicable, a multi-selection box should be used.
- If the list of options is short (4 or less) and users can select more than one option, consider using checkboxes instead of a multi-selection list for simplicity and visual clarity.
- Multi-select fields include checkboxes for every single option in the list, the entire row must be clickable.

## Required and error

* A required empty select should show an error message when submitted.
* Helper text can be added to the component, [specs](https://developer.dxc.com/design/components/text-input) are available in the input component.
