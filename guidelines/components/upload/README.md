# Upload

The upload component is used to choose files from any location in the local machine and update those files to the server where the application is hosted. It is a common procedure in applications where files are required like documents, images or other information in digital formats.

## Usage

- Use the specific mode based on the application requirements
- Add some explanation text in the case that it is needed to clarify the information to the user
- By default, the drag and drop appearance is handled by the browser, in case it wants to be customized is the responsibility of the developer
- If the upload process fails, please show an error message avoiding technical or undetermined information (i.e '0x94 ERROR_PATH_BUSY') that won't be understood by the user of the application
