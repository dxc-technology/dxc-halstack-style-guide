# Application Layout

Application layouts form the structure on which application components are built. Our layouts minimize complexity and focus on facilitating a consistent visual flow across all applications. They are made up of four elements: the header, the main content, footer and side navigation.


## Usage

Application layouts are used to place content across the screen for different applications.

### Layout with side navigation

The side navigation functions as an optional fourth element to display additional links or information apart from the links that are displayed as part of the header or footer

1. Header
2. Main content
3. Footer
4. Side Navigation (sidenav)

### Behavior and Interaction

Overlay and push interactions by the sidenav component can alter the way the layout is displayed. For overlay, the sidenav simply slides over the content with no changes to position. The push interaction moves all components to the side depending on the width of the sidenav.
