_Autocomplete specifications_

The specifications for the autocomplete input can be found in the [text-input specs](https://developer.dxc.com/design/guidelines/components/text-input), the option list can be cheked in [the select documentation](https://developer.dxc.com/design/guidelines/components/select)


### Required and helper text

* A required empty select should show an error message when submitted.
* Helper text can be added to the component, specs are available in the [input](https://developer.dxc.com/design/guidelines/components/text-input) component.

### Synchronous vs asynchronous

Two modes can be defined for the autocomplete component, based on the result set that is going to be searchable:

* **Synchronous**: if all the result set is on the application side, the synchronous mode is the one used.
* **Asynchronous**: if the application needs to interact with the APIs in every action of the user the mode will be asynchronous.

### User Interface Design Considerations

Consider using this component:

* When the information to fill is complex or large and you want to assist the user with suggestions to make the process easiest and quicker.
* If the options are a few it would be better to use a select component.
+ Make sure that the error coming from the API is understandable for the user.
