The header is an important component in the interface, it is the area dedicated for the navigation across the application and helps users understand what the content of the page is about. They appear at the top of a page, above the main content.
## Anatomy


* **Brand**: In this area should be placed the company logo, it will go on the left side of the header.

* **Content**:

   * **Application name**: If the application has a specific name, can be placed here.
   * **Primary navigation**: The links and dropdowns with a navigational purpose should be placed here.
   * **Site options**: Language selector, settings, or other any option that applies globally should be placed here. 
   * **Account**: In the case that the application manages accounts, the element for the login and register options should be positioned on the far right except in the tablet and mobile version that will be covered in the following sections.

* There is a special adaptation of the dropdown with a trasparent background design to be a children of the aheader component.


## Responsive version for mobile and tablet

Due to the applications are accessible from a laptop, tablet and mobile it is necessary to think and design a header version for the corresponding device. The design for smaller devices tries to keep the consistency respect to the other versions, allowing the user experiences a similar interaction although the space available is less.
